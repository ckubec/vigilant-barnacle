## Overview Summary
A side project created to showcase my React/Typescript skills and to finally showcase a resume/landing page to point recruiters to. I previously worked at Microsoft using Typescript with the React library. Due to this code being held by Microsoft, I obviously have nothing tangeable to showcase from the time I spent working for them. Therefore giving me a reason to spawn this project, showcase my skills and finally being able to point people at a page that is mine.

This project uses three major web technologies: <b>Typescript</b>, <b>React</b>, and <b>Bootstrap</b> (or more accurately <b>React Bootstrap</b>) as its major pillars, for the following reasons; 

### Typescript
The reasoning behind using <b>typescript</b> is because I wanted something robust, solid... and because I wanted to torture myself. Just kidding about that last bit I really wanted something strongly typed, I wanted the flexibility of the Javascript wild west at the same time as having the structure of a less forgiving language to keep me from forgetting a semi colon.

### React 
Strength in components. Really the only thing that needs to be said about <b>React</b>. I want to create modularity in my site, that way if I want to remove pieces its as easy as removing one component and plopping in a new one in its place. This way sectioning out pieces of the site for later easy refactoring.

### Bootstrap
The reasoning for including <b>React Bootstrap</b> was to get certain CSS/styling for free without having to code everything from scratch. Everyone in the industry loves creating there own solution for the same problem. I also enjoy creating my own solutions however if you can give me a sticky top navbar for free I'm going to take it and use my cycles elsewhere.
